---+!! UnixUsersContrib Contrib Package

This Contrib enables you to replace the Foswiki User and Groups system with a
read only access to the User and Groups in a Unix Database. Registration of
new users and their association with Groups is then _only_ handled by Unix,
but still is possible to create groups in Foswiki normaly.

UnixUsersContrib is based on Foswiki:Extensions.JoomlaUsersContrib by Foswiki:Main.SvenDowideit.
